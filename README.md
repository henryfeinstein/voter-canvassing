Our Approach to Collaboration: 
* A week after the project was assigned, we met up in person to decide how we would start to break up the project. At that meeting, we each decided to take an initial chunk of the project to work on for the next week. We followed the same approach for the remainder of the project, meeting up in person each week, and a few time virtually, to discuss our progress, help each other understand the material, and decide on what next steps needed to be taken and who would tackle each task. We tried to make sure that each of us was working on at least one part of the project each week. We also kept in touch via Slack to update each other on our progress between meetings and to ask each other questions about the project as we came across them. We split up the tasks into pretty small chunks, so it is hard to parse apart exactly what we each did. Morgan led the map initialization and creation of input objects, Henry focused primarily on the data parsing and organization, and Promit led the CSS work and local storage behavior. We all contributed to all of those different aspects, however. 

Stretch goals attempted:
